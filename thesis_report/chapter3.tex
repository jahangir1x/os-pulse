\subsection{User Stories}

User stories provide narrative descriptions of how users will interact with the system:

\textbf{Story 1: Analyzing Suspicious Email Attachment}

\textit{As a security researcher, I need to analyze a suspicious email attachment reported by a user. I upload the file through the web dashboard, create a monitoring session, and start the monitoring agents. I then execute the file in the integrated noVNC viewer and immediately see file operations appearing in the dashboard. The malware attempts to write to the startup folder and creates several registry entries for persistence. Within minutes, I have a complete behavioral profile including network communications to a command-and-control server. I export the analysis data as JSON to share with my team and integrate into our threat intelligence platform.}

\textbf{Story 2: Investigating System Compromise}

\textit{As a malware analyst, I'm investigating a potentially compromised system. I deploy the OS-Pulse agents to the target machine and start monitoring. The dashboard reveals an unusual process chain where a legitimate-looking application spawns multiple child processes that perform suspicious file operations in system directories. The network monitor shows encrypted traffic to an unknown IP address. I use the filtering capabilities to focus on events from this process tree and identify the initial infection vector. The detailed logs allow me to document the entire attack chain for the incident response report.}

\textbf{Story 3: Routine Security Monitoring}

\textit{As a system administrator, I use OS-Pulse to perform routine security monitoring of critical servers. I configure the agents to monitor specific directories and processes of interest. The real-time dashboard helps me quickly identify any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activity. When I notice unusual file operations during off-hours, I can immediately review the details and take appropriate action. The session history allows me to review patterns over time and identify gradual changes in system behavior.}
