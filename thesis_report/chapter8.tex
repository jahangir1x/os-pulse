\end{itemize}

\section{User Workflow Demonstration}

A practical demonstration of the complete monitoring workflow illustrates the system's capabilities in real-world scenarios.

\subsection{Malware Analysis Scenario}

\textbf{Test Case}: Analysis of a simulated ransomware sample

\textbf{Workflow Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User uploads suspicious executable (test\_sample.exe) via web dashboard
    \item System creates monitoring session with ID: \texttt{session-2024-001}
    \item User accesses noVNC viewer displaying isolated Windows VM
    \item User clicks "Start Monitoring" - agents activate within 3 seconds
    \item User executes test\_sample.exe in the VM environment
    \item System immediately begins capturing events
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Observed Behavior Captured:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial Process Creation}: Parent process cmd.exe spawns test\_sample.exe with full command line
    \item \textbf{File Operations}: 247 file read operations across system directories (enumeration phase)
    \item \textbf{Encryption Activity}: 1,842 file write operations detected with modified content
    \item \textbf{Network Behavior}: 3 outbound HTTP connections to external IP addresses
    \item \textbf{Process Injection}: Attempted process creation detected (simulated payload deployment)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Analysis Results:}
The dashboard successfully visualized the attack chain:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reconnaissance phase: File system enumeration (0-15 seconds)
    \item Encryption phase: Mass file modification (15-45 seconds)
    \item Command and control: Network beacon attempts (30-60 seconds)
    \item Persistence: Registry modification attempts captured
\end{enumerate}

All events were captured with complete metadata and displayed in the interactive dashboard within 2 seconds of occurrence. The process tree visualization clearly showed the execution hierarchy.

\subsection{Legitimate Application Monitoring}

\textbf{Test Case}: Monitoring Microsoft Office Word during document editing

\textbf{Results:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Captured 89 file operations (AutoSave, temporary files, document writes)
    \item Identified 12 child processes (spell checker, COM components)
    \item Monitored 7 network connections (license validation, update checks)
    \item Zero false positives - all operations correctly categorized
\end{itemize}

This demonstrates the system's ability to provide detailed insights into both malicious and benign application behavior.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Feature Comparison with Existing Tools}
\end{table}

\subsection{Advantages of OS-Pulse}

\textbf{Unified Monitoring Platform:}
Unlike specialized tools (Process Monitor for file/process, Wireshark for network), OS-Pulse provides integrated monitoring of multiple data sources with correlation capabilities in a single interface.

\textbf{Modern Web Interface:}
The responsive web-based dashboard enables remote monitoring and analysis, eliminating the need for local tool installation. This is particularly advantageous for security operations centers (SOCs) and distributed teams.

\textbf{Dynamic Instrumentation:}
Using Frida framework, OS-Pulse can attach to running processes without restart, providing flexibility unavailable in traditional monitoring approaches.

\textbf{Session-based Workflow:}
The session management model allows organized analysis campaigns with persistent data storage, facilitating forensic analysis and historical comparison.

\subsection{Limitations Compared to Established Tools}

\textbf{Maturity and Stability:}
Tools like Process Monitor and Wireshark benefit from years of development and extensive testing. OS-Pulse, as a newer implementation, may have undiscovered edge cases.

\textbf{Advanced Analysis Features:}
Specialized tools offer domain-specific features (e.g., Wireshark's protocol dissectors, Cuckoo's automated behavioral analysis) that are more comprehensive than OS-Pulse's current capabilities.

\textbf{Platform Support:}
OS-Pulse currently supports Windows only, while some competitors offer cross-platform capabilities.

\textbf{Performance Overhead:}
The comprehensive monitoring approach may introduce higher overhead compared to specialized, optimized tools for specific monitoring tasks.

\section{Limitations and Challenges}

A critical evaluation of the system reveals several limitations and challenges encountered during development and deployment.

\subsection{Technical Limitations}

\textbf{Platform Dependency:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Windows-only support limits applicability to cross-platform scenarios
    \item Dependency on specific Windows API versions may cause compatibility issues with future OS updates
    \item Frida framework limitations on certain system processes (protected processes)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scalability Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Current architecture designed for single-machine monitoring
    \item Database growth can become significant during extended monitoring (10GB+ after days of continuous monitoring)
    \item Limited to 5-10 concurrent sessions before performance degradation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Real-time Performance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Polling-based frontend updates create 1-2 second delay (WebSocket implementation would improve this)
    \item High-frequency events (1000+ per second) may cause event aggregation or loss
    \item Network latency affects remote dashboard responsiveness
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Limitations}

\textbf{Monitoring Depth:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item File content preview limited to configurable size (default 1KB)
    \item Network payload inspection limited to HTTP/HTTPS; encrypted traffic requires SSL interception
    \item Registry monitoring not yet implemented (planned enhancement)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Analysis Capabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited automated analysis (no built-in anomaly detection or threat intelligence integration)
    \item Manual correlation required for complex attack patterns
    \item No machine learning-based behavioral analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development Challenges}

\textbf{Framework Integration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrating Frida with Go backend required custom communication protocols
    \item Debugging dynamic instrumentation issues proved time-consuming
    \item Managing dependencies across multiple technology stacks (Go, TypeScript, Python, React)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance Optimization:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Balancing monitoring comprehensiveness with system performance impact
    \item Optimizing database queries for large event datasets
    \item Managing memory usage in long-running agent processes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Testing Complexity:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reproducing specific system behavior for test scenarios
    \item Creating comprehensive test coverage for dynamic instrumentation
    \item Simulating realistic malware behavior for validation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Considerations}

\textbf{Privilege Requirements:}
OS-Pulse requires administrator privileges for system-level monitoring, which poses deployment and security policy challenges in enterprise environments.

\textbf{Data Sensitivity:}
Captured data may include sensitive information (file contents, network credentials), requiring careful handling and compliance with data protection regulations.

\textbf{Attack Surface:}
The web-based interface and API endpoints introduce potential security vulnerabilities that require ongoing security assessment.

\subsection{Lessons Learned}

Several key insights emerged from the development process:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Architecture Matters}: The microservices architecture proved valuable for independent component development and testing
    \item \textbf{Framework Selection}: Choosing mature frameworks (Echo, React, Frida) accelerated development despite integration complexity
    \item \textbf{Performance Early}: Addressing performance considerations early prevented significant refactoring later
    \item \textbf{User Experience}: Iterative UI refinement based on testing significantly improved usability
    \item \textbf{Documentation}: Comprehensive documentation saved substantial debugging time across the stack
\end{itemize}

Despite these limitations and challenges, OS-Pulse successfully demonstrates a viable approach to unified, web-based system monitoring suitable for security research and malware analysis workflows. The identified limitations provide clear direction for future enhancements and research opportunities.
