\chapter{Implementation}

This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the implementation process for OS-Pulse, covering the development of backend services, agent system components, frontend interface, and their integration. The implementation follows a modular approach with clearly defined boundaries between components, enabling parallel development and independent testing. Each section describes the architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and key challenges encountered during development.

\section{Backend Implementation}

The backend serves as the central coordination layer, managing API requests from the frontend, orchestrating agent activities, processing monitoring events, and ensuring data persistence. The implementation follows a three-layer architecture pattern: handlers for HTTP processing, services for business logic, and repositories for data access.

\subsection{API Development}

The RESTful API provides the communication interface between the web frontend and backend services. The API design follows REST principles with resource-based endpoints and appropriate HTTP methods for different operations.

\subsubsection{API Structure and Organization}

The API is organized into logical groups based on functionality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Session Management Endpoints:} Handle creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of monitoring sessions. These endpoints manage session lifecycle and maintain session metadata including status, timestamps, and configuration parameters.
    
    \item \textbf{Event Endpoints:} Provide access to captured monitoring events with support for filtering, pagination, and sorting. These endpoints handle high-volume event retrieval efficiently using database indexing and query optimization.
    
    \item \textbf{Agent Control Endpoints:} Coordinate with the agent system for starting, stopping, and configuring monitoring activities. These endpoints act as a bridge between the web interface and the distributed agent system.
    
    \item \textbf{File Upload Endpoints:} Manage secure file uploads from the frontend to the agent system. Implement multipart form data handling and file streaming for efficient large file transfers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Request Handling Strategy}

The Echo framework provides the foundation for HTTP request processing. Each endpoint is implemented as a handler function that receives a context object containing request data and provides methods for sending responses.

Request processing follows a consistent pattern:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Request validation and parameter extraction
    \item Authentication and authorization checks (future enhancement)
    \item Business logic execution through service layer
    \item Response formatting and error handling
    \item Logging and monitoring
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Error Handling and Response Format}

A standardized error handling mechanism ensures consistent error responses across all API endpoints. Errors are categorized by type (validation errors, database errors, agent communication errors) and mapped to appropriate HTTP status codes.

Response formats follow a consistent JSON structure with fields for status, data, and error messages. This consistency simplifies frontend development and error handling on the client side.

\subsubsection{Middleware Implementation}

Custom middleware functions handle cross-cutting concerns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CORS Middleware:} Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to allow the React frontend to communicate with the backend API from different origins during development.
    
    \item \textbf{Logging Middleware:} Records all incoming requests with timestamps, HTTP methods, paths, and response times for debugging and performance monitoring.
    
    \item \textbf{Error Recovery Middleware:} Catches panics and converts them into proper HTTP error responses, preventing server crashes from unhandled errors.
    
    \item \textbf{Request ID Middleware:} Assigns unique identifiers to each request for tracing through logs and debugging distributed operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database Integration}

PostgreSQL serves as the persistent storage layer, with GORM providing object-relational mapping capabilities. The database design balances flexibility for diverse event types with query performance for real-time data retrieval.

\subsubsection{Database Schema Design}

The database schema consists of two primary tables:

\textbf{Sessions Table:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stores monitoring session metadata including session ID, status, start/end times, and configuration
    \item Primary key on session ID with automatic UUID generation
    \item Indexed on status and created\_at columns for efficient session querying
    \item Includes foreign key relationships for potential multi-user support
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Events Table:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stores all monitoring events with flexible JSONB payload column
    \item Composite indexing on session\_id and timestamp for efficient event retrieval
    \item Event type field with index for filtering by operation category
    \item JSONB column allows storage of varied event structures without schema modifications
    \item GIN index on JSONB column enables efficient queries on nested JSON fields
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ORM Configuration and Usage}

GORM provides database abstraction with automatic schema generation and migration capabilities. The ORM is configured with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Connection pooling with configurable maximum connections and idle timeouts
    \item Automatic timestamp fields for created\_at and updated\_at columns
    \item Soft delete support for data retention without physical deletion
    \item Query logging in development mode for debugging and optimization
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Repository Pattern Implementation}

The repository pattern separates data access logic from business logic, providing several benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Abstraction:} Business logic layer does not depend directly on GORM or database implementation details
    \item \textbf{Testability:} Repositories can be mocked for unit testing business logic without database dependencies
    \item \textbf{Maintainability:} Database-specific code is centralized in repository implementations
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} Database implementation can be changed without modifying service layer code
\end{itemize}

Repository interfaces define methods for common database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) plus specialized query methods for complex filtering and aggregation.

\subsubsection{Query Optimization Strategies}

Several strategies optimize database query performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pagination with cursor-based or offset-based approaches for large result sets
    \item Selective field loading to retrieve only necessary columns
    \item Eager loading of related data to prevent N+1 query problems
    \item Query result caching for frequently accessed, slow-changing data
    \item Prepared statement usage for repeated queries with different parameters
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session Management}

Session management coordinates monitoring activities across multiple components and maintains state throughout the monitoring lifecycle.

\subsubsection{Session Lifecycle}

A monitoring session progresses through several states:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Created:} Session initialized with unique ID, ready for configuration
    \item \textbf{Configured:} Monitoring parameters and target information set
    \item \textbf{Active:} Agents deployed and actively monitoring target system
    \item \textbf{Paused:} Monitoring temporarily suspended, state preserved
    \item \textbf{Stopped:} Monitoring completed, final data processing
    \item \textbf{Archived:} Session data retained for historical analysis
\end{enumerate}

State transitions are managed through the service layer with validation ensuring only valid state changes are permitted.

\subsubsection{Session Configuration Management}

Each session maintains configuration parameters controlling monitoring behavior:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Target process identifiers and names
    \item Monitoring scope (file operations, network traffic, process creation)
    \item Data capture limits (maximum bytes for file content, network payload truncation)
    \item Filtering rules to reduce noise and focus on relevant events
    \item Retention policies for automatic data cleanup
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Concurrent Session Support}

The architecture supports multiple simultaneous monitoring sessions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Session isolation ensures events from different sessions do not interfere
    \item Database queries scoped by session ID prevent data leakage
    \item Agent coordination layer maintains separate agent instances per session
    \item Resource management prevents excessive system load from concurrent sessions
\end{itemize}

\section{Agent System Implementation}

The agent system comprises multiple specialized components working together to capture system behavior. The implementation emphasizes modularity, allowing independent development and testing of each agent type.

\subsection{Frida-based Injection}

The Frida injector provides runtime instrumentation capabilities without requiring process modification or restart.

\subsubsection{Injection Strategy and Process Attachment}

The injection process follows a carefully orchestrated sequence:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Process identification by name, PID, or pattern matching
    \item Frida session establishment with target process
    \item Script compilation from TypeScript to JavaScript
    \item Script injection into target process memory space
    \item Hook installation on target Windows API functions
    \item Callback registration for event notification
\end{enumerate}

The injector handles multiple process attachment scenarios including attaching to running processes and spawning new processes with immediate instrumentation.

\subsubsection{API Hooking Implementation}

Windows API hooking targets critical system functions in kernel32.dll and ntdll.dll:

\textbf{File Operations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ReadFile and WriteFile for file content access monitoring
    \item CreateFileW for file creation and opening tracking
    \item DeleteFileW for file deletion detection
    \item GetFinalPathNameByHandle for converting file handles to paths
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Process Operations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NtCreateUserProcess for process creation monitoring
    \item CreateProcessW for Win32 process creation tracking
    \item TerminateProcess for process termination detection
    \item GetCommandLineW for command-line argument extraction
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Network Operations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item send and recv for socket data transmission monitoring
    \item connect for connection establishment tracking
    \item WSAConnect for Windows-specific socket connections
\end{itemize}

Each hook intercepts the original function call, extracts relevant parameters, generates an event structure, and forwards it to the backend while allowing the original function to proceed.

\subsubsection{Event Data Extraction and Formatting}

Event extraction implements careful memory handling to prevent crashes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Safe memory reading with bounds checking and exception handling
    \item Configurable data size limits to prevent excessive memory consumption
    \item String encoding detection and conversion (UTF-8, UTF-16)
    \item Binary data encoding to Base64 for JSON transmission
    \item Timestamp generation using high-resolution performance counters
\end{itemize}

Event structures contain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Event type and subtype classification
    \item Process ID, thread ID, and module information
    \item Function parameters (file paths, process names, network addresses)
    \item Return values and error codes
    \item Content data (file contents, network payloads) with size limits
    \item Timing information for performance analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Memory Management and Resource Control}

Proper memory management prevents agent-induced system instability:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bounded event queues prevent unlimited memory growth
    \item Periodic garbage collection of processed events
    \item Resource cleanup on agent shutdown or error conditions
    \item Memory allocation tracking for leak detection
    \item Configurable memory limits with automatic throttling when exceeded
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Network Monitoring}

The network monitoring component captures and analyzes network traffic using multiple approaches for comprehensive coverage.

\subsubsection{HTTP/HTTPS Traffic Interception}

HTTP traffic monitoring operates at the application protocol level:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proxy-Based Interception:} Transparent proxy intercepts HTTP requests and responses
    \item \textbf{SSL/TLS Handling:} Certificate generation for HTTPS interception while maintaining security
    \item \textbf{Request Parsing:} Extraction of HTTP methods, headers, URLs, and body content
    \item \textbf{Response Capture:} Recording of status codes, headers, and response bodies
    \item \textbf{Protocol Analysis:} Detection of API calls, authentication mechanisms, and data formats
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Raw Packet Capture}

Low-level packet capture provides comprehensive network visibility:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Packet capture using Windows Packet Capture (WinPcap) or Npcap libraries
    \item BPF filter application to reduce captured traffic volume
    \item Protocol dissection for TCP, UDP, DNS, and other protocols
    \item Connection tracking to correlate packets into sessions
    \item Payload extraction with content-type detection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Traffic Analysis and Classification}

Captured traffic undergoes automated analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Protocol identification through port numbers and packet signatures
    \item Data exfiltration detection through upload size and pattern analysis
    \item Communication pattern analysis (beaconing, command-and-control traffic)
    \item Geographic analysis of destination IP addresses
    \item Suspicious behavior flagging (connections to known malicious IPs, unusual ports)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Event Processing}

Event processing transforms raw monitoring data into structured events suitable for storage and analysis.

\subsubsection{Event Collection and Buffering}

Events from multiple agents are collected and buffered before transmission:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Thread-safe event queues for multi-threaded agent operation
    \item Batch assembly to reduce network overhead
    \item Priority queuing for critical events requiring immediate transmission
    \item Overflow handling when event generation exceeds processing capacity
    \item Timestamp normalization across different agent types
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Event Validation and Sanitization}

Events undergo validation before backend transmission:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Schema validation ensuring all required fields are present
    \item Data type verification and conversion
    \item Size limit enforcement for content fields
    \item Sensitive data redaction (passwords, authentication tokens)
    \item Malformed data handling and error reporting
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Backend Communication}

Agents communicate with the backend through a well-defined protocol:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RESTful API endpoints for event submission
    \item JSON serialization of event structures
    \item HTTP compression for bandwidth efficiency
