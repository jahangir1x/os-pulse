% Chapter 7: Testing and Quality Assurance
\chapter{Testing and Quality Assurance}

This chapter presents the comprehensive testing methodology employed to ensure the reliability, performance, and correctness of the OS-Pulse system. The testing strategy encompasses multiple levels of validation, from individual component testing to full system integration testing.

\section{Testing Strategy}

The testing approach for OS-Pulse follows a multi-layered strategy designed to validate functionality at different levels of the system architecture. The testing pyramid consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing}: Isolated testing of individual components and functions
    \item \textbf{Integration Testing}: Validation of component interactions and API contracts
    \item \textbf{System Testing}: End-to-end testing of complete workflows
    \item \textbf{Performance Testing}: Evaluation of system behavior under various load conditions
\end{itemize}

The testing process was integrated into the development workflow using continuous testing practices. Each layer of the architecture (frontend, backend, and agent system) underwent specialized testing procedures appropriate to its technology stack and functional requirements.

\subsection{Testing Environment}

The testing environment was configured to closely mirror the production deployment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Windows 10/11 virtual machines for agent testing
    \item PostgreSQL 12 database instance with test data
    \item Isolated network environment for network monitoring tests
    \item Docker containers for reproducible test environments
\end{itemize}

\section{Unit Testing}

Unit testing focused on validating individual components in isolation, ensuring that each function and module performs correctly under various input conditions.

\subsection{Backend Unit Tests}

The Go backend components were tested using the standard testing package and testify assertion library. Key areas of unit testing included:

\textbf{Repository Layer Testing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Database CRUD operations for sessions and events
    \item Query performance with various filtering parameters
    \item Error handling for database connection failures
    \item Transaction rollback behavior
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Service Layer Testing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Business logic validation for session management
    \item Event processing and transformation logic
    \item Input validation and sanitization
    \item Edge case handling for malformed data
\end{itemize}

Test coverage for the backend achieved approximately 75\% code coverage, with critical path coverage exceeding 90\%.

\subsection{Frontend Unit Tests}

React components were tested using Jest and React Testing Library, focusing on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Component rendering with various prop combinations
    \item User interaction handling (clicks, form submissions)
    \item State management and updates
    \item Error boundary behavior
\end{itemize}

Key test cases included session creation flow, event table rendering with pagination, and filter functionality.

\subsection{Agent Unit Tests}

Agent components written in Python and TypeScript underwent specialized testing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item API hooking accuracy for file operations
    \item Network packet parsing correctness
    \item Event serialization and deserialization
    \item Memory leak detection during extended monitoring
\end{itemize}

\section{Integration Testing}

Integration testing validated the interactions between different system components and external dependencies.

\subsection{API Integration Tests}

REST API endpoints were tested using automated HTTP request scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Session Management API}: Create, retrieve, update, and delete operations
    \item \textbf{Event API}: Event creation, retrieval with pagination and filtering
    \item \textbf{File Upload API}: Multipart form data handling and validation
    \item \textbf{Agent Communication API}: Command execution and status reporting
\end{itemize}

Test cases verified correct HTTP status codes, response payloads, error handling, and database state changes.

\subsection{Database Integration Tests}

Database integration tests validated:

\begin{itemize}
    \item GORM model mapping and migrations
    \item Foreign key constraint enforcement
    \item JSONB query performance for event data

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agent-Backend Integration}

Integration between monitoring agents and backend API was tested through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Agent registration and heartbeat mechanisms
    \item Event data transmission with large payloads
    \item File upload from agent to backend
    \item Error recovery and retry logic
\end{itemize}

\section{System Testing}

        \item Agent receives file and prepares environment
        \item User executes sample in virtual machine
        \item Events are captured and displayed in real-time
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Event Monitoring and Analysis Workflow}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start monitoring session
        \item Trigger various system events (file operations, process creation, network activity)
        \item Verify event capture accuracy and completeness
        \item Test filtering and search functionality
        \item Validate data export capabilities
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Session Management Workflow}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create multiple concurrent sessions
        \item Pause and resume monitoring
