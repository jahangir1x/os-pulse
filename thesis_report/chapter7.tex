% Chapter 7: Testing and Quality Assurance
\chapter{Testing and Quality Assurance}

This chapter presents the comprehensive testing methodology employed to ensure the reliability, performance, and correctness of the OS-Pulse system. The testing strategy encompasses multiple levels of validation, from individual component testing to full system integration testing.

\section{Testing Strategy}

The testing approach for OS-Pulse follows a multi-layered strategy designed to validate functionality at different levels of the system architecture. The testing pyramid consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing}: Isolated testing of individual components and functions
    \item \textbf{Integration Testing}: Validation of component interactions and API contracts
    \item \textbf{System Testing}: End-to-end testing of complete workflows
    \item \textbf{Performance Testing}: Evaluation of system behavior under various load conditions
\end{itemize}

The testing process was integrated into the development workflow using continuous testing practices. Each layer of the architecture (frontend, backend, and agent system) underwent specialized testing procedures appropriate to its technology stack and functional requirements.

\subsection{Testing Environment}

The testing environment was configured to closely mirror the production deployment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Windows 10/11 virtual machines for agent testing
    \item PostgreSQL 12 database instance with test data
    \item Isolated network environment for network monitoring tests
    \item Docker containers for reproducible test environments
\end{itemize}

\section{Unit Testing}

Unit testing focused on validating individual components in isolation, ensuring that each function and module performs correctly under various input conditions.

\subsection{Backend Unit Tests}

The Go backend currently has limited automated testing. Manual testing was the primary validation method:

\textbf{API Endpoint Testing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual testing using Postman or curl commands
    \item Verification of session creation and event storage
    \item Database state validation through PostgreSQL client
    \item CORS configuration tested with frontend integration
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Areas Without Automated Tests:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GORM model validation and relationships
    \item Handler logic for edge cases
    \item Error handling paths
    \item Concurrency handling for simultaneous requests
\end{itemize}

Note: Automated unit tests for the Go backend are planned but not yet implemented.

\subsection{Frontend Unit Tests}

The React frontend currently has no automated tests implemented:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual browser testing for UI interactions
    \item Developer console inspection for errors
    \item Network tab validation of API requests
    \item Visual inspection of component rendering
\end{itemize}

Planned testing approach would use:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jest for JavaScript testing framework
    \item React Testing Library for component testing
    \item Focus on critical user workflows (upload, start/stop monitoring, event display)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agent Unit Tests}

Python agent controller has basic test files for API integration:

\textbf{Existing Test Files:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item test\_controller.py: Basic controller initialization tests
    \item test\_api.py: API endpoint connectivity tests
    \item test\_api\_integration.py: End-to-end API integration tests
    \item test\_api\_server.py: Mock API server for testing
    \item test\_webhook\_integration.py: Webhook endpoint testing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Coverage:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Controller initialization and argument parsing
    \item API endpoint connectivity and response validation
    \item Event posting to backend endpoints
    \item Basic error handling scenarios


\section{Integration Testing}

Integration testing validated interactions between system components through manual testing and basic automated scripts.

\subsection{API Integration Tests}

Python test files provide basic API integration validation:

\textbf{test\_api\_integration.py:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tests POST requests to /api/events/events endpoint
    \item Validates event storage in PostgreSQL database
    \item Checks JSON payload formatting and response codes
    \item Verifies session ID linking for events
\end{itemize}

\textbf{test\_webhook\_integration.py:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tests HTTP POST to backend webhook endpoints
    \item Validates payload delivery and processing
    \item Checks error handling for malformed requests
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Manual API Testing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Session creation through frontend UI
    \item Event retrieval via GET /api/events/:sessionId
    \item Monitoring start/stop through MonitoringControls component
    \item Cross-component data flow validation (agent → backend → frontend)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database Integration Tests}

Database integration validated through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item GORM AutoMigrate creating schema on startup
    \item Direct PostgreSQL queries to verify event storage
    \item Session and event relationship validation
    \item JSONB column data integrity checks
    \item Connection pooling under load (manual observation)
\end{itemize}

No automated database integration test suite exists currently.

\subsection{Agent-Backend Integration}

Integration between monitoring agents and backend API tested manually:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Controller sending Frida events to /api/events/events
    \item HTTP interceptor sending traffic data to /api/http/events
    \item Network monitor sending packet data to /api/net/events
    \item Backend successfully storing events from all agent types
    \item JSON payload validation and error responses
    \item Event retrieval through frontend polling mechanism
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Validation Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Database queries to verify event storage
    \item Console logging for debugging event flow
    \item Network tab in browser dev tools for API calls
    \item PostgreSQL client for direct database inspection
\end{itemize}

\section{System Testing}

System testing evaluated complete end-to-end workflows through manual execution and observation.

\subsection{Functional System Tests}

Complete user workflows tested manually:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sample Upload and Execution Workflow}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User uploads Windows executable through frontend
        \item Frontend creates session via POST /api/create-session
        \item User manually starts controller with session ID and PID
        \item Sample executes in VM (accessed via noVNC)
        \item Events captured by Frida hooks and sent to backend
        \item Frontend polls and displays events in real-time tables
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Event Monitoring and Analysis Workflow}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start monitoring by clicking Start button in UI
        \item Interact with application in VM (file operations, network requests)
        \item Observe file events appear in File Operations tab
        \item Check process events in Process Events tab
        \item Verify network activity in Network Activity tab
        \item Validate event data accuracy against actual operations
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Session Management Workflow}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create session through file upload
        \item Start monitoring for specific PID
        \item Stop monitoring via Stop button
        \item Verify events persist after monitoring stops
        \item Session data retrievable through GET /api/events/:sessionId
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{noVNC Integration Workflow}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Access VM through embedded noVNC iframe
        \item Verify keyboard and mouse input forwarding
        \item Test zoom adjustment (automatic 50\% on monitoring start)
        \item Confirm split-screen layout with events side-by-side
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Compatibility Testing}

The system was tested in a limited development environment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Windows Version}: Windows 10/11 (host and VM)
    \item \textbf{Browsers}: Primarily Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based), limited Firefox testing
    \item \textbf{Screen Resolutions}: 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 (desktop-optimized)
    \item \textbf{Python Version}: Python 3.8+ for agents
    \item \textbf{Go Version}: Go 1.21+ for backend
    \item \textbf{Node Version}: Node.js 18+ for frontend
    \item \textbf{PostgreSQL Version}: PostgreSQL 14+
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limited Mobile Support:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frontend not optimized for mobile devices
    \item Primary focus on desktop/laptop usage
    \item Responsive design partially implemented via Tailwind
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Testing}

Security validation was minimal due to local development focus:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No formal security testing conducted
    \item GORM parameterized queries provide basic SQL injection protection
    \item No authentication/authorization to test
    \item File upload accepts any file type (intentional for malware analysis)
    \item System assumes trusted local environment
    \item VM isolation provides primary security boundary
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Testing}

Performance testing was observational rather than systematic, focused on basic usability validation.

\subsection{Manual Performance Observations}

\textbf{Event Capture Performance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frida hooks capture events with minimal visible latency
    \item File operations monitored without noticeable application slowdown
    \item Network monitoring operates in background without UI impact
    \item No formal benchmarks or metrics collected
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Frontend Responsiveness:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item UI remains responsive with hundreds of events displayed
    \item Event polling every 2 seconds does not cause UI freezing
    \item noVNC iframe provides acceptable VM interaction latency
    \item No testing with thousands of events (potential performance issue)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Database Performance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Event storage appears instantaneous for typical workloads
    \item Event retrieval fast for sessions with <1000 events
    \item No testing of large-scale event storage (10,000+ events)
    \item Connection pooling configured but not stress-tested
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Limitations Identified}

\begin{itemize}
    \item No pagination: All events fetched on every poll
    \item No incremental updates: Entire event list returned each request
    \item Event tables may slow with large datasets
    \item No virtual scrolling for large event lists
    \item Backend lacks response caching
    \item No load testing performed
    \item No concurrency testing beyond basic multi-tab usage
\end{itemize}

\section{Results and Analysis}

    \item \textbf{Environment Reproducibility}: Consistent test environments for dynamic instrumentation testing
    \item \textbf{Performance Variability}: Different Windows versions exhibited varying API behavior
    \item \textbf{Frida Framework Limitations}: Occasional injection failures required retry mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quality Assurance Measures}

Challenges encountered during testing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Testing Frida hooks requires actual Windows applications to monitor
    \item Reproducing specific malware behaviors difficult without real samples
    \item Manual testing time-consuming for repetitive workflows
    \item Debugging distributed system (agents + backend + frontend) complex
    \item Database state inspection requires direct PostgreSQL queries
    \item No automated test infrastructure increases regression risk
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quality Assurance Practices}

Informal quality measures implemented:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual code review before integrating new features
    \item Console logging for debugging and error tracking
    \item Browser dev tools for frontend debugging
    \item PostgreSQL client for database state validation
    \item Version control with Git for code history
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lacking Quality Measures:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No formal code review process
    \item No static analysis tools configured (Go vet, ESLint unused)
    \item No continuous integration pipeline
    \item No automated test execution on commits
    \item Minimal inline documentation
    \item No formal API specifications
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The testing and validation of OS-Pulse relied primarily on manual testing and informal quality assurance. While core workflows were validated through repeated execution, the lack of comprehensive automated testing leaves gaps in coverage and increases the risk of regressions.

The basic Python integration tests provide some automated validation of agent-backend communication, but frontend testing is entirely manual. Performance characteristics were observed informally but not systematically measured or benchmarked.

For a research and development system, this testing approach was sufficient to validate core functionality and demonstrate the concept. However, production deployment would require implementing comprehensive automated testing, formal performance benchmarking, security audits, and continuous integration practices.
