## User Story and Workflow

### Complete User Journey: From Sample Upload to Analysis

The OS-Pulse platform provides a seamless workflow for security researchers and analysts to monitor and analyze system behavior. Here's the complete user story:

#### Step 1: Sample Upload and Session Creation
**User Action**: Security researcher uploads a suspicious executable file (malware sample) through the web dashboard
**System Response**: 
- Frontend creates a new monitoring session with unique session ID
- File is securely transmitted to the backend via REST API
- Backend forwards the file to the agent service for processing
- Agent service prepares the monitoring environment and confirms readiness

#### Step 2: Virtual Environment Interaction
**User Action**: User accesses the integrated noVNC viewer within the web dashboard
**System Response**:
- noVNC client displays the virtual machine desktop environment
- User can interact with the VM as if using a remote desktop
- Virtual machine is isolated and prepared for safe malware execution
- Dashboard automatically adjusts zoom to 50% when monitoring begins for optimal viewing

#### Step 3: Monitoring Initialization
**User Action**: User clicks "Start Monitoring" button in the dashboard
**System Response**:
- Frontend sends monitoring start command to backend
- Backend coordinates with agent service to begin instrumentation
- Agent deploys Frida-based injectors to target processes
- Network monitoring components activate to capture traffic
- Monitoring status indicators turn green, confirming active monitoring

#### Step 4: Sample Execution and Real-Time Analysis
**User Action**: User executes the uploaded sample within the noVNC environment
**System Behavior**:
- Target executable runs within the monitored environment
- Frida agents immediately begin capturing system events:
  - File operations (reads, writes, creates, deletes)
  - Process creation and termination events
  - Network connections and HTTP traffic
  - Registry modifications and system API calls
- Events are processed and transmitted to backend in real-time

#### Step 5: Live Event Visualization
